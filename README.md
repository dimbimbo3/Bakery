# Bakery
My Final Project for Database Systems at MSU 

For this final project I have developed an ecommerce storefront based around a
bakery that specializes in desserts. The bakery sells an assortment of sweets, under the
specific categories of brownies, cakes, cookies, donuts, and puddings. 
The website provides different access for customers, employees, as well as the
CEO. The landing page opens by greeting users with a login screen, where they are
able to create a customer account or login with their existing account (which will
determine if they are an employee or a customer).

When customers log in they are presented with a page that contains a brief
description of the business and a navigation bar that provides various functions, such
as: access to the entire product list (which is divided into categories and allows for the ability to
search through every item based on a customer's entered terms); their current cart (containing the
quantities and totals of any items they have placed inside, as well as the ability to
complete their order); an account settings page (where they can edit the details
associated with their account, change their password, as well as view their previous order
history and the specifics of each individual order); and the ability to log out of their
account.

When employees log in they are presented with a page that displays the list of
current employees (along with their employee IDs, department IDs, whether they are
the manager of their department, their names, and their phone numbers). The
navigation bar provided also gives them access to the following: a page containing the
list of products on the database (including their individual product IDs, category IDs,
product names, prices, image locations, and their available stock); a page showcasing
the orders placed by customers (including their order IDs, order dates, order totals, and
the emails identifying the customers who placed them); and the ability to log out of their
account.

As mentioned above, there is also a third group of access reserved for the owner
of the business. They have a view similar to that of the employees, but with the
following alterations: on the employee list page they also have the option to add new
employees, fire current ones, or make an employee the manager of their department;
on the product page they have the option to add new products, change the price of
existing products, or alter a productâ€™s stock; and on the order history page they can
remove any placed orders
